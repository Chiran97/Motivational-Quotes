Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow
When you give joy to other people, you get more joy in return. You should give a good thought to happiness that you can give out.
The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same.
The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.
You learn more from failure than from success. Don’t let it stop you. Failure builds character.
Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
If you are working on something that you really care about, you don’t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.
